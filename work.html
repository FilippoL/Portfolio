            <h1>Linux enviroment</h1>
                              <p>
                                I still remember the day I first googled linux.
                                Since then my quest of knowledge of Linux machines as well as the Open Source Community
                                has been growing stronger. I began to be familiar with the command line, and found it pretty straight
                                forward, with the helpful reading of
                                <a href = "https://github.com/rsgranne/linux-phrasebook-2nd-edition" target="_blank">The Linux Phrasebook </a>.
                                I like to keep my laptop always with a Linux partition as well as a Windows one.
                                At the moment I'm trying Fedora (essential - command line only- ) and I'm quite liking it.
                                I enjoy switching from Windows to Ubuntu, and from Ubuntu to OSX (my home desktop).

                                Having been introduced to C++ only two years ago, I look forward to further my skills and knowledge in the networking side of the language - see the micro:bit section below.

                                The Bsc in Games Programming I am attending pushed me to learn on a practical level more than on a theoretical one.

                                It is not just about graphics, but rather more about problem solving, safe memory management and data handling.

                                 <li>I have been building a 3d engine using OpenGL with a colleague from University. We have been making use of some design patterns
                                   and OOP techniques, so to make it more self contained (reference needed to <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/" target="_blank">this book</a> and to our <a href="http://karstenvermeulen.com/index.html" target="_blank">amazing teacher</a>).
                                   The engine compiles, links and renders shader programs, making use of buffers for filling data, playing music/SFX,
                                  and having an exchangeable camera system.</li>

                <h1>Micro <l></l> Controllers</h1>
                <p>
                  I have grown a strong passion for devices that make the DIY a must, by opening technologies and
                  resources to anyone!
                  I first bought my Raspberry PI to get introduced to such a unique device. Then I started discovering the
                  world of micro-controllers (in the second year of my diploma I've attended a module on Arduino programming).
                  Having achieved a successful communication between the RaspberryPI and a UNO board, I have now moved onto
                  the Micro:Bit board - which is unique in its own right.
